        <p class="standard-font">We are in the midst of the largest tsunami-like change in the real estate industry,
            driven by the urgent need to reconcile social and environmental goals. Real estate owners need reliable
            sustainability performance data and effective decision-making tools for investment to address the impending
            regulations and challenges of retrofitting.</p>

        <h3 class="h2-text">ESG Regulatory Requirements</h3>
        <p class="standard-font">Becoming stricter every year and apply to more and more companies. Non-compliance ->
            Bad reputation (We need text here) ESG legal regulation affects not only the renovation and management of
            existing buildings from an energy perspective, but also their assessment and financing.</p>

    <div class="section-four-boxes__box">
        <h3 class="h2-text">Depreciation</h3>
        <p class="standard-font">The trend towards more sustainability and social responsibility, supported by ESG
            regulation, leads to one of the most significant transformations and disruptions in the real estate industry
            with significant impacts on its economic value (devaluations ranging from 15% to total failure) and its
            social influence (market value, profitability).</p>

    <div class="section-four-boxes__box">
        <h3 class="h2-text">High Interest Rates</h3>
        <p class="standard-font">Due to ESG regulatory requirements, banks are increasingly offering more favorable
            credit
            terms for real estate financing that meet these ESG criteria. Non-ESG compliant properties will no longer be
            creditworthy in the future (by banks and institutional funds/investors, etc.).</p>

        <h3 class="h2-text">Strategic Investment Uncertainty</h3>
        <p class="standard-font">The real estate industry lacks the data and parameters to make the right strategic
            investment and restructuring decisions in the face of this massive threat to its business model. A
            billion-dollar industry that has only known an upward trend for decades is an analog industry. There has
            been no
            need for digitization.</p>

                individual strategic investment factors as well as the impacts of policy or regulatory changes into the
                decision-making process. This is done through AI-driven proprietary algorithms and statistical models
                capable of creating automated and targeted ESG due diligences, strategies, analyses, and reports based
                on a sparse data situation. This way, real estate investors and policymakers can visualize the effects
                of ESG criteria and regulations based on minimal data and significantly minimize their risks."</p>
