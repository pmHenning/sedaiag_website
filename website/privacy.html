        personal data with us if you are allowed to do so and this personal data is correct.</p>

        process this data on our behalf. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other Google data.
        The IP addresses are anonymized so identification is not possible (IP masking).</p>


    <p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note
        that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.</p>


    <p>You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website

        of Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, D04 E5W5, Dublin, Ireland (hereinafter referred to as:
        Google). With the Google Tag Manager, tags of Google’s services and of third-party providers can be managed,
        bundled and embedded on an online presence. Tags are small code elements on an online presence that are used,
        among other things, to measure visitor numbers and behavior, to record the impact of online advertising and
        social channels, to use remarketing and targeting, and to test and optimize online presences. When a user visits
        the online presence, the current tag configuration is sent to the user’s browser. It contains instructions on
        which tags to trigger. Google Tag Manager&nbsp; triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. Information
        on this can be found in the section on the use of the corresponding services in this Privacy Policy. Google Tag
        Manager does not access this data.<br>Further information on Google Tag Manager can be found at

        integration of third-party services. The legal basis for the processing of the personal data of users is in
        principle the consent of the user according to Art. 6 para. 1 p.1 lit. a GDPR.</p>


    <p>Your personal information will be retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this
        Privacy Policy or as required by law. Advertising data in server logs is anonymized by Google by deleting parts
        of the IP address and cookie information after 9 and 18 months respectively.</p>


    <p>You have the right to revoke your declaration of consent under data protection law at any time. The revocation of
        consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the
        revocation.</p>


    <p>You can prevent the collection as well as the processing of your personal data by Google by preventing the
        storage of third-party cookies on your computer, using the ‘Do Not Track’ function of a supporting browser,
        disabling the execution of script code or installing a script blocker such as NoScript (https://noscript.net/)
        or Ghostery (https://www.ghostery.com) on your browser.</p>


    <p>You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the online
        presence (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and

    <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Data subject rights</strong></h2>


    <p>You have the right:</p>


    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;In accordance with Art. 15 GDPR, to request information about your personal data processed by us. In
            particular, you can request information about the processing purposes, the category of personal data, the
            categories of recipients to whom your data has been or will be disclosed, the planned storage period, the
            existence of a right to rectification, erasure, restriction of processing or objection, the existence of a
            right of complaint, the origin of your data if it has not been collected by us, and the existence of
            automated decision-making, including profiling, and, if applicable, meaningful information about its
            details;
        </li>


        <li>&nbsp;pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR, to request the correction of incorrect or incomplete personal data stored by
            us without undue delay;
        </li>


        <li>pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR, to request the erasure of your personal data stored by us, unless the processing
            is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a
            legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
            claims;
        </li>


        <li>pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR, to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data, insofar as the
            accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, but you object to its erasure and we no
            longer require the data, but you need it for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or you have
            objected to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR;
        </li>


        <li>pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, to receive your personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, common
            and machine-readable format or to request that it be transferred to another responsible party;
        </li>


        <li>in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR, to revoke your consent once given to us at any time. This has the
            consequence that we may no longer continue the data processing, which was based on this consent, in the
            future; and
        </li>


        <li>complain to a supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 77 GDPR. As a rule, you can contact the
            supervisory authority of your usual place of residence or workplace or our company headquarters for this
            purpose (in Switzerland, the competent data protection authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and
            Information Commissioner (http://www.edoeb.admin.ch)).
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>Right of objection</p>


    <p>If your personal data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) f GDPR, you have
        the right to object to the processing of your personal data pursuant to 21 GDPR, provided that there are grounds
        for doing so that arise from your particular situation or if the objection is directed against direct marketing.
        In the latter case, you have a general right of objection, which is implemented by us without specifying a
        particular situation.</p>


    <p>If you would like to exercise your right of revocation or objection, please send an e-mail to:
        verwaltung@ella-group.io.</p>


    <p>Please note, however, that we reserve the right to assert the restrictions provided for by law on our part, for
        example if we are obliged to retain or process certain data, have an overriding interest in doing so (insofar as
        we are entitled to invoke this) or require it for the assertion of claims. If costs are incurred by you, we will
        inform you in advance.</p>


    <p>The exercise of your data subject rights also generally requires that you clearly prove your identity (e.g. by
        means of a copy of your ID card, if your identity is otherwise not clear or cannot be verified).</p>


    <p>Furthermore, every data subject has the right to enforce his or her claims in court or to file a complaint with
        the competent data protection authority. The competent data protection authority in Switzerland is the Federal
        Data Protection and Information Commissioner (http://www.edoeb.admin.ch).</p>
