    <h3 class="h3-text">Data protection</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We
        treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and
        this privacy policy.</p>

        can be used to personally identify you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it
        for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
    <p class="standard-font">We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when
        communicating by email) may have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third
        parties is not possible.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Information about the responsible party</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
    <p class="standard-font">SedAI AG</br>
        Suurstoffi 18</br>
        6434 Rotkreuz</br>
        Switzerland</br>
        Phone: Not specified</br>
        Email: info@sedai.ag</p>
    <p class="standard-font">The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others
        decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Storage period</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">Unless a specific storage period is specified within this privacy policy, your personal
        data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate
        request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other
        legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the
        latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">General information about data processing</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of
        Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according
        to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the event of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries,
        data processing also takes place on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the
        storage of cookies or access to information on your terminal device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data
        processing additionally takes place on the basis of ยง 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.
        If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual
        measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if
        this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also
        occur based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each
        individual case are explained in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Recipients of personal data</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">In the course of our business activities, we cooperate with various external entities.
        Sometimes, the transmission of personal data to these external entities is necessary. We only disclose personal
        data to external entities if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to
        do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para.
        1 lit. f GDPR in the disclosure, or if another legal basis allows data disclosure. When using processors, we
        only disclose personal data of our customers based on a valid contract for order processing. In the case of
        joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can
        revoke consent that has already been given at any time. The legality of data processing carried out before the
        revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
        OBJECT AT ANY TIME, FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA;
        THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING CAN BE FOUND
        IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
        DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS,
        OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21
        PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
    <p class="standard-font">IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
        TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS
        ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA
        WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2
        GDPR).</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint
        with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or
        place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other
        administrative or judicial remedy.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Right to data portability</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent
        or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If
        you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent that it
        is technically feasible.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Information, correction, and deletion</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free
        information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, the purpose of data processing, and, if
        necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions
        regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Right to restriction of processing</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You
        can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="standard-font">If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time
            to verify this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to request the restriction of the
            processing of your personal data.
        </li>
        <li class="standard-font">If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the
            restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li class="standard-font">If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or
            assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal
            data instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li class="standard-font">If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck
            between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have
            the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="standard-font">If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data โ apart from their
        storage โ may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or
        for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest
        of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as
        orders or inquiries you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize
        an encrypted connection by the address line of the browser changing from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock
        symbol in your browser line.</p>
    <p class="standard-font">When SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by
        third parties.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Objection to promotional emails</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation for
        sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby prohibited. The operators of the pages
        expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information,
        such as through spam emails.</p>
    <h2 class="h2-text">4. Data collection on this website</h2>
    <h3 class="h3-text">Inquiry via email, telephone, or fax</h3>
    <p class="standard-font">If you contact us by email, telephone, or fax, your inquiry including all resulting
        personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We do
        not pass these data on without your consent.</p>
    <p class="standard-font">The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, provided your request
        is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
        In all other cases, the processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) and/or on our
        legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR), as we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing
        of inquiries addressed to us. The data sent to us by you via contact requests remain with us until you request
        us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after
        completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain
        unaffected.</p>
    <h2 class="h2-text">5. Plugins and Tools</h2>

        behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p>

        This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If a corresponding
        consent has been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR
        and ยง 25 para. 1 TTDSG, provided the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the
